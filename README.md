This project aims to transfer the past python bikesharing project to Dask.

There are 3 Python Notebooks as well as 5 python scripts which feed information into the .ipynb files.

EDA.ipynb covers the Exploratory Data Analysis part
Model Testing.ipynb covers the different iterations for feature engineering - didn't succeed to run it with Dask due to a problem in the utils.py file
Final Model and Plotting Results.ipynb covers the final selected model
